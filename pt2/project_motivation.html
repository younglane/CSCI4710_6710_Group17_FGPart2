			<h2>Project Motivation</h2>
			<p>The motivation for this project is to give Sunset Cedar a band website that they could use for getting noticed around the Raleigh, NC area. This website will include pictures of the band members with description of each member in the band. Another page with links to their social media pages and the individual band member social media links. It will provide an all in one stop shop for information on the band and their music for increasing their fan base as well as getting noticed by managers.</p>
