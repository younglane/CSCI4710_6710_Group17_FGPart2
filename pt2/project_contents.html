			<h2>Project Contents</h2>
			<p>Ideas to implement would be a carousel of photos at the beginning to showcase the entire band with a navigation bar. A page that has a description of each band member with their social media connected. Linking social media to the website and pop up in a separate window for the users. Another page for their music and videos to be played. A list of live show dates, times, and locations to keep the fans updated of where to find them. Time permitting could implement a merch store for purchasing items online for fans to get their hands on.</p>
